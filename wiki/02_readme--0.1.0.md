> MERN Full Stack App with Authentication and Subscription

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application, offering a robust platform for users to sign up and log in to access various services. The application will be designed with a focus on security, scalability, and user experience, employing cutting-edge technologies and practices such as Docker, Kubernetes, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and Redux.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality, enabling users to access the platform's services.
-   **Subscription Management**: Users can subscribe to different services offered by the platform, with support for various subscription tiers.
-   **Security**: Implementation of JWT for secure transmission of information, along with XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to safeguard against common web vulnerabilities.
-   **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Proper configuration to allow or restrict resources based on the origin, ensuring the platform's API is securely accessible.
-   **State Management**: Utilizing Redux for efficient state management across the React.js frontend.
-   **Routing**: Employing React Router for dynamic and client-side routing, enhancing the single-page application (SPA) experience.

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, React Router
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Security**: JWT, XSS and CSRF protection mechanisms
-   **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes for orchestration
-   **Others**: CORS setup for secure API communication

## Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:

    - Node.js and npm installed
    - Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration
    - MongoDB setup locally or remotely

2. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:

    - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
    - Install dependencies: `npm install`
    - Start the development server: `npm start`

4. **Backend Setup**:

    - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    - Install dependencies: `npm install`
    - Start the server: `npm run dev`

5. **Docker and Kubernetes Setup**:

    - Ensure Docker and Kubernetes are correctly installed and configured.
    - Build Docker images for the frontend and backend.
    - Deploy the application using Kubernetes manifests.

6. **Environment Variables**:
    - Configure necessary environment variables for database connections, JWT secret keys, and any third-party APIs.

## Security Considerations

-   Ensure all user data is validated and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
-   Implement CSRF tokens in forms to protect against CSRF attacks.
-   Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
-   Securely store and manage JWT tokens to prevent interception or misuse.
-   Configure CORS policies appropriately to allow legitimate requests while blocking malicious ones.

## Contribution Guidelines

-   Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
-   Write clear and meaningful commit messages.
-   Ensure code follows the established coding standards and practices.
-   Submit pull requests for review.
